Hi! My name is Miguel and Iâ€™m a software developer and tech recruiter based in Lisbon, Portugal.

As a developer, I enjoy building products with Python and Vue.js the most. I also have a post-graduate degree in Data Science.

As a recruiter, I typically help companies set up proper recruitment processes and find remote developers from Europe or South America.
